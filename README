Welcome to Twitter Mapping, an application to map countries mentioned in tweets to countries
and show them on a map.

Twitter mapping has a few dependencies which are listed in the requirements.txt file.

Twitter mapping also uses Django South, which allows us to version database schemas
Data for the application such as Country data is stored in the fixtures folders under each app.

=== Alterations for Specification ===
Originally this application was supposed to show a specific twitter feed, but I have been forced
to make the feed configurable.

=== Bugs ===
There is a bug on the index page that effects the profile and logout buttons where the page
preview function binds web previews to them.
